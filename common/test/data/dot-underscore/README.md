IGNORE MAC METADATA FILES

This course simulates an import of a course from a Mac OS that has some unnessary 
metadata files (filename starts with ._) in assets (static/._example.txt). These 
files do not belong with the content so skip them on import and also do a 
cleanup for such already added assets.
