"""
Implementation the CyberSource credit card processor.

IMPORTANT: CyberSource will deprecate this version of the API ("Hosted Order Page") in September 2014.
We are keeping this implementation in the code-base for now, but we should
eventually replace this module with the newer implementation (in `CyberSource2.py`)

To enable this implementation, add the following to Django settings:

    CC_PROCESSOR_NAME = "CyberSource"
    CC_PROCESSOR = {
        "CyberSource": {
            "SHARED_SECRET": "<shared secret>",
            "MERCHANT_ID": "<merchant ID>",
            "SERIAL_NUMBER": "<serial number>",
            "PURCHASE_ENDPOINT": "<purchase endpoint>"
        }
    }
